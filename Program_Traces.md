> How to collect Function call traces for a given code?

Function call traces can be collected by using a profiler. A profiler is a tool that can record and analyze the performance of a program, including the sequence of function calls and their timing information. Here are some common methods for collecting function call traces:

1.  Using a built-in profiler: Some programming languages, such as Python, have built-in profilers, such as cProfile, that can be used to collect function call traces.
    
2.  Using a third-party profiler: There are many third-party profilers available for various programming languages, such as perf for C/C++ and Java, and New Relic for Node.js.
    
3.  Instrumenting the code: You can manually add tracing code to your program to collect function call traces. This method gives you complete control over the information that is collected and the way it is collected, but it can also be time-consuming and error-prone.
    

Once you have collected the function call traces, you can use the profiler's results to identify bottlenecks and optimize your code.

> How to use perf profiler to get function call traces for a c++ program?

The `perf` profiler is a performance analysis tool for Linux that can be used to collect function call traces for a C++ program. Here are the general steps to use `perf` to get function call traces:

1.  Install `perf`: If you don't have `perf` installed, you can install it using your Linux distribution's package manager.
    
2.  Compile your C++ program with the `-g` option: This option is necessary to provide debugging information to the profiler.
    
3.  Run your program with `perf record`: This command collects performance data and stores it in a `perf.data` file. For example:
    
    shell
    
    ```shell
    $ perf record ./your_program
    ```
    
4.  Analyze the collected data with `perf report`: This command generates a report of the collected data and displays it in a text-based interface. For example:
    
    ruby
    
    ```ruby
    $ perf report
    ```
    
5.  Filter the data to display only the function call traces: To display only the function call traces, you can use the `-g` option with `perf report`. For example:
    
    ruby
    
    ```ruby
    $ perf report -g
    ```
    

Note that `perf` has many other options and subcommands that can be used to customize and control the performance analysis. You can use `perf help` to see the full list of options and subcommands.

> How to install perf on ubuntu?

To install `perf` on Ubuntu, you can use the following steps:

1.  Update the package index:
    
    ruby
    
    ```ruby
    $ sudo apt update
    ```
    
2.  Install the `linux-tools` package:
    
    ruby
    
    ```ruby
    $ sudo apt install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic
    ```
    
3.  Verify that `perf` is installed:
    
    css
    
    ```css
    $ perf --version
    ```
    

Note that the exact package name may vary depending on your version of Ubuntu and your architecture (e.g., `linux-tools-<kernel version>-<architecture>`). You can use `apt search perf` to find the correct package name for your system.

> Write a fuzzer which generates test cases which can differentiate a correct and incorrect program.

A fuzzer is a tool that generates random inputs for a program in order to test its behavior. To write a fuzzer that generates test cases that can differentiate a correct and incorrect program, you need to have a good understanding of the program's expected behavior and the types of inputs that can trigger incorrect behavior.

Here's a simple example of how to write a fuzzer in Python that generates test cases for a function that should return the sum of two numbers:

python

```python
import random

def fuzzer():
    while True:
        a = random.randint(-100, 100)
        b = random.randint(-100, 100)
        yield (a, b)

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

for test_case in fuzzer():
    result = add(*test_case)
    if result < -100 or result > 100:
        print("Incorrect program output:", result)
```

In this example, the `fuzzer` function generates random test cases, each consisting of two numbers, and the `add` function is the program under test. The main loop of the fuzzer generates test cases using `fuzzer` and then passes them to `add` to test its behavior. If `add` returns a result that is outside of the expected range (-100 to 100), the fuzzer reports an error.

This is just a simple example, but the same principle can be applied to more complex programs. The key is to understand the expected behavior of the program and to generate test cases that can trigger incorrect behavior if the program is not implemented correctly.

> What is AFL?

AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) is an open-source fuzz testing tool developed by Michal Zalewski. It is designed to generate random inputs for a program and test its behavior in order to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.

AFL works by generating input data in a way that explores the program's behavior in a more targeted and efficient manner. Unlike other fuzzers that generate random input data, AFL uses a technique called "coverage-guided fuzzing" to determine which parts of the program's input space are being exercised and to focus the fuzzing process on those areas. This results in a more efficient and effective fuzz testing process.

AFL has been used to discover a large number of security vulnerabilities in widely-used software, including the Linux kernel, OpenSSL, and many others. It is widely regarded as one of the best fuzz testing tools available and is used by many organizations and security researchers.

> What is the difference between AFL and AFL++?

AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) and AFL++ are both open-source fuzz testing tools developed by Michal Zalewski. The main difference between the two is that AFL++ is an improved and extended version of AFL.

AFL is a coverage-guided fuzz testing tool that uses genetic algorithms and selective mutation to generate inputs that maximize code coverage and find bugs and security vulnerabilities. AFL++ extends the functionality of AFL by adding several new features, such as:

1.  Multi-threading support: AFL++ supports multi-threading out-of-the-box, which can significantly speed up the fuzzing process.
    
2.  Hardware-based instrumentation: AFL++ includes hardware-based instrumentation, which can be faster and more accurate than software-based instrumentation.
    
3.  Advanced trace analysis: AFL++ includes advanced trace analysis techniques, such as tracing through JIT-compiled code and tracing through forks, to find bugs and security vulnerabilities in complex programs.
    
4.  Improved handling of input files: AFL++ includes improved handling of input files, such as handling of large files and memory-mapped I/O, to enable more effective fuzzing of large and complex programs.
    
5.  New fuzzing algorithms: AFL++ includes several new fuzzing algorithms, such as edge-case-driven fuzzing and different forms of guided fuzzing, to further improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the fuzzing process.
    

In summary, AFL++ is a more advanced and feature-rich version of AFL that provides improved performance, accuracy, and versatility for fuzz testing.

> Write a fuzzer which can generate python programs which perform sorting of the list of integers fed to it as input.

Here's a simple example of a fuzzer in Python that generates programs that perform sorting of a list of integers:

python

```python
import random
import ast

def fuzzer():
    while True:
        num_elements = random.randint(1, 100)
        test_case = [random.randint(-100, 100) for _ in range(num_elements)]
        yield test_case

for test_case in fuzzer():
    program = "result = sorted({})".format(test_case)
    code = compile(program, "<string>", "exec")
    exec(code)
    if result != sorted(test_case):
        print("Incorrect program output:", result)
```

In this example, the `fuzzer` function generates random test cases, each consisting of a list of integers, and the `compile` and `exec` functions are used to compile and execute the generated Python code. The main loop of the fuzzer generates test cases using `fuzzer` and then generates and executes the sorting program. If the sorted list returned by the program is not equal to the expected sorted list, the fuzzer reports an error.

This is just a simple example, but the same principle can be applied to more complex programs. The key is to generate program code that performs the desired behavior and to use the appropriate techniques (such as `compile` and `exec` in this case) to execute the generated code and test its behavior.

> The above code should store each generated python sorting program in a different file.

Here's an updated version of the fuzzer that stores each generated Python sorting program in a separate file:

python

```python
import random
import ast

def fuzzer():
    while True:
        num_elements = random.randint(1, 100)
        test_case = [random.randint(-100, 100) for _ in range(num_elements)]
        yield test_case

for i, test_case in enumerate(fuzzer()):
    program = "result = sorted({})".format(test_case)
    code = compile(program, "<string>", "exec")
    with open("program_{}.py".format(i), "w") as f:
        f.write(program)
    exec(code)
    if result != sorted(test_case):
        print("Incorrect program output:", result)
```

In this updated version, the main loop of the fuzzer generates test cases using the `fuzzer` function and then generates and executes the sorting program. Each generated program is stored in a separate file, with the file name `program_{i}.py` where `i` is the index of the test case. If the sorted list returned by the program is not equal to the expected sorted list, the fuzzer reports an error.

> The generated python program for sorting should take input from the user and should not have pre-defined inputs.

Here's an updated version of the fuzzer that generates Python sorting programs that take input from the user, rather than using pre-defined inputs:

python

```python
import random
import ast

def fuzzer():
    while True:
        num_elements = random.randint(1, 100)
        yield num_elements

for i, num_elements in enumerate(fuzzer()):
    program = """
n = int({})
l = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
result = sorted(l)
print(result)
    """.format(num_elements)
    with open("program_{}.py".format(i), "w") as f:
        f.write(program)
```

In this updated version, the main loop of the fuzzer generates test cases using the `fuzzer` function and then generates the sorting program. The generated program prompts the user to input `n` numbers, which are then sorted and printed. Each generated program is stored in a separate file, with the file name `program_{i}.py` where `i` is the index of the test case.

> The fuzzer program should provide input to the generated sorting program and see if it crashes or not.

Here's an updated version of the fuzzer that generates Python sorting programs that take input from the user, tests the programs using randomly generated inputs, and reports any crashes:

python

```python
import random
import ast
import subprocess

def fuzzer():
    while True:
        num_elements = random.randint(1, 100)
        yield num_elements

for i, num_elements in enumerate(fuzzer()):
    program = """
n = int({})
l = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
result = sorted(l)
print(result)
    """.format(num_elements)
    with open("program_{}.py".format(i), "w") as f:
        f.write(program)

    test_input = " ".join(str(random.randint(-100, 100)) for _ in range(num_elements))
    process = subprocess.Popen(["python3", "program_{}.py".format(i)], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
    stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input=test_input.encode())
    if process.returncode != 0:
        print("Program crashed with error:")
        print(stderr.decode())
    else:
        print("Program output:")
        print(stdout.decode())
```

In this updated version, the main loop of the fuzzer generates test cases using the `fuzzer` function and then generates the sorting program. The generated program prompts the user to input `n` numbers, which are then sorted and printed. The fuzzer provides randomly generated inputs to each generated program using the `subprocess` module and captures the output and error streams. If the process returns a non-zero return code, indicating a crash, the fuzzer reports the error. Each generated program is stored in a separate file, with the file name `program_{i}.py` where `i` is the index of the test case.
