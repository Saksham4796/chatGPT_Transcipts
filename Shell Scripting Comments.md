> How to give comments in shell script?

In shell scripting, comments are used to add notes and explanations to your code. Comments can help you or other programmers understand what your code does and why you wrote it that way. There are two ways to add comments to a shell script:

1.  Single-line comments: Single-line comments begin with a hash symbol (#) and continue to the end of the line. Anything after the hash symbol is ignored by the shell.

Example:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a single-line comment.
echo "Hello, World!" # This is also a single-line comment.
```

2.  Multi-line comments: Multi-line comments start with `:` followed by a newline character and end with `:` on a separate line.

Example:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
: '
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write as much as you want here.
'
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Note that some shells may not support multi-line comments. In such cases, single-line comments can be used to achieve the same effect by adding a `#` character at the beginning of each line of the comment block.

> what to write in a shell script so as to execute all the commands present in the different shell script?

To execute all the commands present in a different shell script from within another shell script, you can use the `source` or `.` command followed by the path of the script you want to execute. This will read and execute all the commands in the specified script as if they were entered directly into the current script.

For example, let's say you have a script called `myscript.sh` that contains the commands you want to execute, and you want to execute those commands from within another script called `main_script.sh`. You can include the following line in `main_script.sh` to execute `myscript.sh`:

bash

```bash
source /path/to/myscript.sh
```

or

bash

```bash
. /path/to/myscript.sh
```

Replace `/path/to/myscript.sh` with the actual path to your script file.

Note that the `source` and `.` commands are equivalent and can be used interchangeably. When you use `source` or `.`, the commands in the specified script are executed in the current shell environment, which means any variables or functions defined in the script will be available in the current script.

> How to check where is the python present which is currently in use in ubuntu?

To check the location of the Python executable that is currently in use in Ubuntu, you can use the `which` command. The `which` command searches for the location of a program in the directories listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

Open a terminal window and type the following command:

bash

```bash
which python
```

This command will display the full path to the Python executable that is currently in use in your Ubuntu system. For example, the output might be `/usr/bin/python`.

If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your system, you can check the version number of the currently active Python interpreter by running the following command:

css

```css
python --version
```

This will display the version number of the Python interpreter that is currently in use.

> What is the bashrc file in ubuntu?

The `.bashrc` file is a script file that is executed whenever a new interactive shell is started in Ubuntu using the Bash shell. It is a user-specific file and is located in the user's home directory (`~/.bashrc`).

The purpose of the `.bashrc` file is to define environment variables, aliases, functions, and other settings that are specific to the user's shell sessions. These settings can include things like customizing the prompt, defining command aliases, and setting up environment variables that are needed for various applications or scripts.

The `.bashrc` file is read and executed each time a new terminal window or console is opened or a new interactive Bash shell is started. This allows the user to have consistent settings and environment variables throughout their shell sessions.

It is important to note that changes made to the `.bashrc` file only affect the current user's shell sessions. If you want to set environment variables or aliases that should be available system-wide, you can add them to the system-wide configuration files such as `/etc/environment` or `/etc/bash.bashrc`.

> shell command to delete a directory only if it exists?

To delete a directory only if it exists, you can use the `rmdir` command with the `-p` option, which removes the directory only if it is empty, and the `&&` operator to execute the command only if the directory exists. Here's an example:

bash

```bash
rmdir -p /path/to/directory && echo "Directory deleted successfully."
```

This command will attempt to remove the directory specified by `/path/to/directory`. If the directory exists and is empty, it will be deleted and the message "Directory deleted successfully." will be displayed. If the directory does not exist or is not empty, no action will be taken and no error message will be displayed.

Note that if the directory contains files or subdirectories, the `rmdir` command will fail and you may need to use the `rm` command instead to delete the directory and its contents. However, be careful when using the `rm` command, as it can permanently delete files and directories without the possibility of recovery. To avoid accidental deletion of files, always double-check the paths and options before executing the `rm` command.

> shell command to delete a non empty directory only if it exists?

To delete a non-empty directory only if it exists, you can use the `rm` command with the `-r` option, which recursively removes all files and directories inside the specified directory, and the `-f` option to force the removal without prompting for confirmation. You can then use the `&&` operator to execute the command only if the directory exists. Here's an example:

bash

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/directory && echo "Directory deleted successfully."
```

This command will attempt to remove the directory specified by `/path/to/directory`. If the directory exists and is not empty, all its files and subdirectories will be recursively deleted and the message "Directory deleted successfully." will be displayed. If the directory does not exist, no action will be taken and no error message will be displayed.

Note that the `rm` command can permanently delete files and directories without the possibility of recovery, so be careful when using it. Double-check the paths and options before executing the command to avoid accidental deletion of important files.

> How to set environment variables in Dockerfile?

You can set environment variables in a Dockerfile using the `ENV` instruction. The `ENV` instruction sets the value of one or more environment variables that will be available to any processes running inside the Docker container. Here's an example of how to set an environment variable in a Dockerfile:

css

```css
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENV MY_VAR="Hello World"
```

In this example, we are setting an environment variable called `MY_VAR` to the value `"Hello World"`. The `ENV` instruction takes the form `ENV <key> <value>`, where `<key>` is the name of the environment variable and `<value>` is its value.

You can also set multiple environment variables in a single `ENV` instruction by separating them with spaces:

css

```css
FROM ubuntu:latest
ENV VAR1="value1" VAR2="value2"
```

Note that environment variables set using the `ENV` instruction are persistent across container restarts and are available to all subsequent commands in the Dockerfile as well as to any processes running inside the container.

Once you have set environment variables in your Dockerfile, you can use them in your scripts or applications running inside the container just like you would use any other environment variable.

> How to install environment variables such as JAVA in PYSPARK which we generally set in our bashrc file on the ubuntu system in the Dockerfile?

To install environment variables such as JAVA in PYSPARK in a Dockerfile, you can use the `ENV` instruction to set the environment variables. Here's an example of how to install and set the JAVA environment variable in a Dockerfile for use with PYSPARK:

bash

```bash
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install Java
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk && \
    apt-get clean;

# Set Java environment variable
ENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/
ENV PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

# Install PYSPARK
RUN pip install pyspark
```

In this example, we first install the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 using the `apt-get` command. We then set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path where Java is installed and add the Java binary directory to the `PATH` environment variable. Finally, we install PYSPARK using the `pip` command.

Note that the `ENV` instruction sets environment variables for the container, but it does not modify the user's `.bashrc` file. If you want to set environment variables for the user's Bash shell, you can add the following line to your Dockerfile:

bash

```bash
RUN echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/' >> ~/.bashrc
```

This command adds a line to the user's `.bashrc` file that sets the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. However, this modification will only take effect for Bash shells started within the container, not for the host system. If you want to set environment variables for the host system, you will need to modify the `.bashrc` file on the host system directly.

> The command '/bin/sh -c sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jre && sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk' returned a non-zero code: 127

The error message you received indicates that the `apt-get` command failed with a non-zero exit code of 127. Exit code 127 usually indicates that the command you tried to execute was not found or could not be run for some other reason.

One possible reason for this error could be that the `sudo` command is not available in the container image you are using. The `sudo` command is often not included in minimal or lightweight Docker images, as it is not necessary in most cases. If you are using such an image, you may need to switch to a different image that includes the `sudo` command, or modify your Dockerfile to install the required packages without using `sudo`.

Another possible reason for the error could be a network connectivity issue that prevented the `apt-get` command from connecting to the package repository to download the required packages. You can try running the `apt-get` command again with the `--fix-missing` option to see if that resolves the issue:

sql

```sql
sudo apt-get update --fix-missing
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jre
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk
```

If the issue persists, you may need to investigate further to determine the root cause of the error. You can try running the `apt-get` command with the `-v` option to enable verbose output and see if that provides any additional information about the error.

> How to execute mutiple commands in one go?

To execute multiple commands in one go, you can separate the commands using a semicolon `;`, double ampersand `&&`, or double vertical bar `||` depending on your desired behavior.

Here are some examples:

1.  Using semicolons to execute commands sequentially:

`command1 ; command2 ; command3`

This will execute `command1`, wait for it to finish, then execute `command2`, wait for it to finish, and finally execute `command3`.

2.  Using double ampersands to execute commands conditionally:

`command1 && command2 && command3`

This will execute `command1` and only if it succeeds (i.e., returns exit status 0), it will execute `command2`. Similarly, it will execute `command3` only if `command2` succeeds.

3.  Using double vertical bars to execute commands conditionally:

`command1 || command2 || command3`

This will execute `command1` and only if it fails (i.e., returns a non-zero exit status), it will execute `command2`. Similarly, it will execute `command3` only if `command2` fails.

Note that when using the `&&` and `||` operators to execute commands conditionally, the subsequent command(s) will not be executed if the previous command fails or succeeds, respectively. This can be useful in scripts where you want to handle errors or exceptions gracefully.

For example, to execute multiple commands in one line using double ampersands, you can use the following command:

`command1 && command2 && command3`

This will execute `command1` and only if it succeeds, it will execute `command2`. Similarly, it will execute `command3` only if `command2` succeeds.

> How to execute mutiple commands written in mutilple lines in one go in a shell language?

In a shell script, you can execute multiple commands written in multiple lines in one go by using a backslash (`\`) at the end of each line to indicate that the command continues on the next line. This is called line continuation.

Here's an example:

`command1 \   && command2 \   && command3`

In this example, the `&&` operator is used to execute the commands conditionally. The backslash at the end of each line indicates that the command continues on the next line.

Note that you can use any of the operators (`;`, `&&`, `||`) to separate the commands as per your requirement. Also, make sure to add proper indentation to make the code more readable.

Here's another example using the `;` operator:

`command1 \   ; command2 \   ; command3`

This will execute `command1`, `command2`, and `command3` sequentially, regardless of the exit status of each command.

Make sure to also use proper quoting and escaping if required to handle special characters or spaces in the commands.

> Is this the right way: sudo apt-get update \\ && sudo DEBIAN\_FRONTEND=noninteractive \\ && sudo apt-get -y install default-jre-headless \\ && sudo apt-get clean \\ && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/\*

No, the command you provided is not correct.

In your command, you have used `sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` as a separate command. However, this is not a valid command. Instead, `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` is an environment variable that can be set before running the `apt-get` command to suppress interactive prompts during package installation.

Here's the corrected command:

csharp

```csharp
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update \
	&& sudo apt-get -y install default-jre-headless \
	&& sudo apt-get clean \
	&& sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

In this command, we have set the `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` environment variable before running the `apt-get update` command. Then, we have used the `&&` operator to execute the subsequent commands conditionally. Finally, we have used `sudo apt-get clean` to clean up the apt cache and `sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*` to remove the package lists.

> Is the below command has some error: sudo mkdir -p /opt/spark \\ && sudo cd /opt/spark \\ && sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz \\ && sudo tar xvf spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz

Yes, there is an error in the command you provided.

In the second command, `sudo cd /opt/spark` will not change the current working directory to `/opt/spark`. This is because the `cd` command is executed in a subshell created by the previous command. So, when the second command is executed, the current working directory will still be the same as before.

To change the current working directory in the same shell, you can use the `cd` command without `sudo`. Here's the corrected command:

bash

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/spark \
	&& cd /opt/spark \
	&& sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz \
	&& sudo tar xvf spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz
```

In this command, we have removed `sudo` from the `cd` command. This will change the current working directory to `/opt/spark`. Then, we have used `sudo wget` to download the Spark tarball and `sudo tar xvf` to extract the contents of the tarball in the same directory. Note that we still need to use `sudo` with the `wget` and `tar` commands because we are downloading and extracting files in a directory that requires superuser privileges.

> Are the below commands correct be directly written to .sh file? export SPARK\_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3 export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK\_HOME/bin

Yes, the commands you provided are correct to be directly written to a `.sh` file.

These commands are used to set environment variables for Spark, where `SPARK_HOME` is set to the Spark installation directory and `PATH` is updated to include the `bin` subdirectory of the Spark installation. This allows you to run Spark commands from the terminal without specifying the full path to the Spark binary.

You can create a `.sh` file, let's say `set_spark_env.sh`, and add these commands to the file using a text editor. Make sure to add a shebang line at the beginning of the file to specify the shell to use. For example, if you are using Bash, you can add the following line at the beginning of the file:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Then, save the file and make it executable using the `chmod` command:

bash

```bash
chmod +x set_spark_env.sh
```

To use the environment variables, you can run the `.sh` file using the `source` command:

bash

```bash
source set_spark_env.sh
```

This will execute the commands in the current shell and set the environment variables for Spark. You can verify if the environment variables are set correctly by running `echo $SPARK_HOME` and `echo $PATH` in the terminal.

> The below export commands are not setting the environment when put inside the shell file: export SPARK\_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3 export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK\_HOME/bin

If the export commands are not setting the environment variables when put inside a shell script, it's likely because the shell script is executed in a subshell and the variables are not exported to the parent shell.

To export the variables to the parent shell, you can use the `source` command to execute the script in the current shell context. Here's an example:

1.  Create a shell script file, let's say `set_spark_env.sh`, and add the following content:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
```

2.  Make the script file executable using the `chmod` command:

bash

```bash
chmod +x set_spark_env.sh
```

3.  Use the `source` command to execute the script in the current shell context:

bash

```bash
source set_spark_env.sh
```

4.  Verify if the environment variables are set correctly using the `echo` command:

bash

```bash
echo $SPARK_HOME
echo $PATH
```

This should print the values of the environment variables that you have set in the script file.

Alternatively, you can also use the dot (`.`) command instead of `source` to execute the script in the current shell context:

`. set_spark_env.sh`

This is equivalent to the `source` command and will also export the environment variables to the parent shell.

```

This will append the export commands to the .bashrc file so that they persist after reboot.

> Why is the below file not appending the export commands to the ./bashrc file #!bin/bash # Install JAVA sudo DEBIAN\_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install default-jre-headless && sudo apt-get clean && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/\* # Set JAVA Environment export JAVA\_HOME="$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which java))))" sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y wget # Download Spark and set Environment variables sudo mkdir -p /opt/spark \\ && cd /opt/spark \\ && sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz \\ && sudo tar xvf spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz export SPARK\_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3 export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK\_HOME/bin echo 'export JAVA\_HOME="$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which java))))"' >> ~/.bashrc echo 'export SPARK\_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3' >> ~/.bashrc echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK\_HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

The issue with the script is that it is running as a separate process and not affecting the current shell's environment. When you execute the script, it runs in a new shell environment and sets the environment variables locally in that shell instance. However, when the script completes, the shell environment is lost and does not affect the parent shell.

To append the environment variables to `~/.bashrc`, you can try the following:

bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install JAVA

sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install default-jre-headless && sudo apt-get clean && sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set JAVA Environment

echo 'export JAVA_HOME="$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which java))))"' >> ~/.bashrc
export JAVA_HOME="$(dirname $(dirname $(readlink -f $(which java))))"

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y wget

# Download Spark and set Environment variables
sudo mkdir -p /opt/spark \
    && cd /opt/spark \
    && sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/spark/spark-3.3.2/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz \
    && sudo tar xvf spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3.tgz

echo 'export SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3' >> ~/.bashrc
export SPARK_HOME=/opt/spark/spark-3.3.2-bin-hadoop3

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
```

In this script, we first append the environment variable declarations to `~/.bashrc` before we export them. This way, the environment variables get loaded automatically every time a new shell instance is created.
